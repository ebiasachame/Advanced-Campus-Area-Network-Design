Title: Enhancing Network Performance: Quality of Service and Congestion Control in Campus Networks
This project focuses on optimizing network performance in campus environments by implementing Quality of Service (QoS) and congestion control mechanisms to ensure efficient bandwidth utilization, reduced latency, and improved security.

🏗 Key Configurations & Features:
✔ Redundant Links: Prevents single points of failure for high availability.
✔ Link Aggregation (LACP): Configured on the distribution switch to enhance bandwidth and provide failover protection.
✔ LACP & Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP): Implemented on the core switch for load balancing and seamless failover.
✔ Firewall Security: Configured NAT & DMZ to isolate internal and external traffic, ensuring secure internet access.
✔ Router as an Edge Device: Optimizes routing efficiency and maintains security between internal and external networks.
